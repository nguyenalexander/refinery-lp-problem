Linear Optimization Model with a Simple Refinery with Buffer Tanks

This Python Pyomo optimization model is used to model a simple refinery described in the textbook 
"Optimization in Engineering Systems" by Ralph Pike.

The refinery contains an atmospheric distillation tower, reformer, catalytic cracker, and blend pools for premium 
gasoline, regular gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, with fuel gas by-products from the unit operations.

Buffer tanks are used to study different unit shutdowns.
